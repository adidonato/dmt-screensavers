# Trippy DMT OSx ScreeSavers

Created using GIFs in Quartz Composer

## Usage

* Move/Copy the .qtz files located in the qtz folder in this directory to the appropriate directory in order for the OS to pick them up: ``` cp qtz/* ~/Library/Screen\ Savers/ ```

* Create a folder called ``` DMT\ -\ Imgur/ ``` and copy the images in the ```gifs``` and folder to your home like such: ```mkdir ~/DMT\ -\ Imgur/ && cp -r gifs ~/DMT\ -\ Imgur/ ```

* Quit and Reopen Sytem Preferences (if already open) -> Desktop/Screen Savers and pick one of the dmt_saver ScreeSavers.

That's it!

There are currently 6 ScreenSavers in this repo.

I've been lazy so this method is a bit hacky, a better solution may come in the future for GIFs powered ScreeSavers on OSX.
